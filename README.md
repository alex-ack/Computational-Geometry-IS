# Computational Geometry Independent Study

This repository contains my work for my independent study with Norm on computational geometry using Python.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for geometric primitives and algorithms
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the implemented classes and algorithms
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with examples and visualizations
- `data/`: Sample datasets for testing and demonstration
- `docs/`: Weekly progress reports and final study report

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running Tests

Use pytest to run the test suite:

```
pytest tests/
```

## Progress

Check the `docs/weekly_reports/` directory for weekly updates on my progress through the study.

## Final Report

The final report summarizing my learnings and achievements can be found in `docs/final_report.md`.
