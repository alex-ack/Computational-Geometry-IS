This week I researched convex hulls and their corresponding algorithms. A convex hull is basically the smallest "envelope" you can draw around a set of points, like wrapping a rubber band around them and snapping it tight. It’s a key concept in computational geometry and often used in areas like graphics, pathfinding, and pattern recognition. The goal is to find the points that form the outer boundary of a set, ignoring any points inside.

I decided to use Graham’s Scan algorithm for my convex hull implementation. It's pretty efficient and straightforward, and it works by first finding the point with the lowest y-coordinate, then sorting all the other points by their polar angle relative to that point. From there, it checks which points should stay in the hull by determining if the turns are clockwise or counterclockwise. If the turn is clockwise, the last point gets dropped from the hull since it’s "inside" the boundary.

The coding process went pretty smoothly. I built the algorithm and tested it on a small set of points, and it worked exactly as expected. I also set up some visualizations using matplotlib, which was really satisfying because I could see the points and the convex hull clearly drawn around them. The plotting showed me that everything was functioning as it should, which made all the debugging and tweaks worthwhile.

I also wrote a unit test for the convex hull to make sure everything is robust and ready for more complex scenarios down the line. Next up, I might tackle more advanced algorithms or handle special cases like collinear points or duplicates. But for now, I’m happy with how the convex hull implementation turned out.
